# NovaIPtv
IPTV Player for Android Devices 

Overview

Wow! You have just stumbled upon the project that will change ipTV forever. IPtv lacks many features and upgrades that just are not available. This project solves all the user needs and adds a lot more user interactivity and accessibility.

You will begin by connecting the project to an Android device, preferably through Android Studio, and casting it onto the device. It will immediately take you to a landing page with 4 main options: Live TV, Movies, Series, and Favorites.

If you select the Live TV, Movies, or Series option, it will relocate you to a secondary page displaying categories on the left of what you like to watch, and info on the right about what it is you're watching. For example, if you choose Movies and want to watch The Incredibles, it will display a picture of The Incredibles, a description, and some additional information about the movie. NovaIPtv lets you know what you're getting into so you can decide if you'd like to watch it. If you select the favorites option on the landing page, it will relocate you to a list of all your favorite shows!
